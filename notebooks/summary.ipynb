This operates under the assumption that external dataset growth will give us a good indication on the rental price growth.

    "While there are a lot of property data, the number of properties per suburb ends up being quite low since there are many subrubs in Victoria. This explains why NN does not work well when stratified. When we divide these into four rings based on distance to CBD instead of suburbs, we get much better performance. However, this diminishes our ability to predict which subrub grows the most."

Once we have those predictions, we can predict on the average house again with the same number of average beds, baths. And using the crime, income, population data predictions by suburb, this will give us a second value for rent for 2023. Since we have two numbers, we can calculate the growth rate for 2024 and 2025."
